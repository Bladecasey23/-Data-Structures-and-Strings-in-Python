## Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks

- Prompts the user to enter a student's name.
- Retrieves and displays marks from a pre-defined dictionary.
- Displays an error message if the student is not found.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

- Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
- Extracts the first 5 numbers.
- Reverses the extracted list.
- Displays both the original and reversed lists.
